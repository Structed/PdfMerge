A super simple CLI tool to merge PDFs.

Get the Win x64 binary here: https://github.com/Structed/PdfMerge/releases/tag/1.0


## Usage
Just run the tool and add 2 or more PDF file paths as arguments to merge them. Pages will be read in this order and appended to a new `mergePdf.pdf` file in the same directory.
`pdfmerge "c:\pdf1.pdf" "c:\pdf2.pdf" "c:\pdf3.pdf"`
